# BF_BC2-HotkeySet
A set of useful functions for Battlefield: Bad Company 2 (Cheats)

Written in AutoHotKey, to be easily edited and read.

Currently contains 4 features:
1. Controled Fire Mode: intentionally lowers the fire rate for easier recoil control. Adjust fire reate with numpad +- .
2. Shotgun Mode: automates a certain combination of keys after each shot that increases the overall fire rate. This exploits a glitch that is in the core game, but difficult to execute consistently manually.
3. Gunner Mode: Constatnly tries to enter the pilot seat (by using the default F1 control). Avoids a helicopter crash if the previous pilot was shot down.
4. Semi Auto Mode: Makes all firearms behave like semi-automatic rifles.
